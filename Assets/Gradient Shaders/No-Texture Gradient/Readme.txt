Gradient Shader Pack - No-Texture Gradient

The no-texture gradient is a procedurally generated gradient which can be applied to ordinary geometry
where UV coordinates are available. The first UV channel is used to position and adjust the gradient.
The gradient is centered around UV coordinates 0,0. The center can be adjusted or animated within the
shader/material. Also the angle and scaling can be adjusted.

This shader does not require the use of any textures and therefore saves on texture memory and download times.
