Gradient Shader Pack - Fixed Color

The fixed-color shader simply applies one solid color to a mesh, optinally with alpha blending.
It's only purpose is the special case where your gradient is the same color all over, ie you just want
to give your mesh a solid color. For this purpose it is very efficient. The solid-blend version is
the fastest. This can also provide a manual way to apply partial or full clears of the screen to a solid
color.
