Polyhedra Collection, Volume 1
version 1.3

This is a collection of over 120 shapes, all mathematically generated.

They range from the simplest Platonic solids to some rather large
structures Buckminster Fuller would be proud of.

Use them for whatever you like: gems in a pirate treasure, the basis of
buildings or space ships, other worldly props, special effects, or just rocks.

New in Version 1.3:
The OBJ (.obj) files contain UV's and normals. The UV's are a just one of an infinite number of possibilities.
You can import these shapes to modelling programs like Blender, Maya, etc. and change the UV mapping if you like.

There was a bug which caused the 'pivot points' to not be centered in each object. This has been fixed.

Although normals are included, you may prefer a 'smooth' appearance or a 'sharp' appearance. If you prefer a
'sharp' or 'solid' render, simply select the object(s) in the Project view, then in the Inspector change the
setting for Normals from 'Import' to 'Calculate' and set the 'smoothing angle' to 0. For a smoother look, use larger a number.

Each object has its own material by default. You can, of course, change them any way you like.

The Gallery scene contains one of each of these objects.

Version 1.3 gives you the bonus 'Treasure Chest' object, and the TreasureChestGems scene has this with one of each of the
polyhedra in it. They've been set to 'Diamond' shader. Each also has a RigidBody, so if you move the box around, they move nice.

The Dodeca scene is an example of using a UV/texture on the Dodecahedron object.
