Gradient Shader Pack - Texture Only

The texture-only shader does not generate a gradient. It is provided as a courtesy in the situations
where you may wish to simply render your own texture image, which might be the image of a gradient
that you generated in an external graphics application. The first UV channel is used to position the
texture. This shader is extremely efficient at only rendering a texture. If your texture includes
alpha values you can use it with the alpha-blended version. This shader does not especially save memory
or download times, but may be useful in some special cases.
